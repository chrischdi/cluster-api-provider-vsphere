patchesStrategicMerge:
# Set image names / version to use.
# Note: we are not building vm-operator images with Tilt, so those images must be available in a public image repository.
- vm-operator-image-names.yaml

# Set replicas: 1 and imagePullPolicy: Always to make it easier working in Tilt
- vm-operator-replicas.yaml
- vm-operator-pull-policy.yaml

# Set hostNetwork: false because we are running out of the supervisor
# Note: this requires also to drop KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST/PORT variables, which is implemented in a patch below.
- vm-operator-host-network.yaml

# Drop VC cert bundle because we are running out of the supervisor
- vm-operator-drop-certs-volume.yaml

# This patch derives from vm-operator config/wcp/vmoperator/manager_env_var_patch.yaml, but with
# - VSPHERE_NETWORKING = true and NETWORK_PROVIDER = VSPHERE_NETWORK as suggested by the vm-operator maintainers.
# - Replace all the <..> placeholders as per config/local (including drop PRIVILEGED_USERS)
# - Also make sure we are not overriding the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST/PORT to use local host.
