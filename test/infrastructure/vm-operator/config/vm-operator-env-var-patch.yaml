# This patch derives from vm-operator config/wcp/vmoperator/manager_env_var_patch.yaml, but with
# - VSPHERE_NETWORKING = true and NETWORK_PROVIDER = VSPHERE_NETWORK as suggested by the vm-operator maintainers.
# - Replace all the <..> placeholders as per config/local (including drop PRIVILEGED_USERS).
# - Also make sure we are not overriding the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST/PORT to use local host.
